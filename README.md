# Habit Tracker App

Habit Tracker is a modern iOS application designed to help users build and maintain daily habits through structured scheduling, task generation, and progress tracking.

The app allows users to create custom habits, assign specific weekdays, automatically generate daily tasks, and monitor weekly performance through statistics.

# Features
*	Create and manage custom habits
*	Select specific weekdays for each habit
*	Automatic daily task generation
*	Track completion progress
*	Weekly statistics overview


# Technologies Used
*	Swift
*	SwiftUI
*	SwiftData
*	Charts Framework

# Design

The initial UI concept was based on the following UI kit:

UI Workshop – Habit & Routine Tracker Mobile App UI Kit
https://uiworkshop.com/product/habit-routine-tracker-mobile-app-ui-kit-5625/

However:
	•	Not all screens required for the application were included in the kit
	•	Some design elements were inconsistent or lacked logical UX flow
	•	Several components were redesigned and improved
	•	Additional screens were fully designed and implemented independently
The final product is a combination of adapted UI concepts and custom-designed solutions.

# Architecture

The project follows a clean and modular structure:
* Data models separated from UI
* Reusable components
* State-driven UI updates
* Clear separation between habit templates and generated task instances
* Weekly statistics calculated from persisted data

# Future Improvements
* Notifications & reminders
* iCloud sync
* Dark mode customization
* Advanced analytics
* Widgets
